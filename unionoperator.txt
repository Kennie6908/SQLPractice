If we want to display multiple columns at the same time in the same column, we can use the UNION argument. 
First, select something, use UNION, then select the other desired column from whatever table. 
Make sure to use tablename.columnName when you are selecting two columns with the same names. This is proper code. 

-- find all names
SELECT first_name AS Company_Names FROM employee
UNION
SELECT branch_name FROM branch
UNION
SELECT client_name FROM client; 

-- find a list of all clients and branches
-- use tablename.branch_id to avoid confusion when there are two same names! 
SELECT client_name, client.branch_id FROM client
UNION
SELECT supplier_name, branch_supplier.branch_id FROM branch_supplier; 

-- find a list of all money spent or earned by the company
SELECT salary FROM employee 
UNION 
SELECT total_sales FROM works_with;
