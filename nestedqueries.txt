Can use nested queries to provide parameters for another query. 

-- find names of all employees who have sold over 30,000 to a single client. 
-- first we look for employee id of those with sales > 30000, then we use employee table 
-- to find first and last name using that employee id. 
SELECT employee.first_name, employee.last_name
FROM employee
WHERE employee.emp_id IN (
    SELECT works_with.emp_id
    FROM works_with
    WHERE works_with.total_sales > 30000 
); 

/* find all clients who are handled by the branch that Michael Scott manages */ 
-- first we find the branch id given the manager id. Then using that branch id
-- we select the client name with the associated branch id. 
SELECT client.client_name
FROM client
WHERE client.branch_id = (
    SELECT branch.branch_id
    FROM branch
    WHERE branch.mgr_id = 102
    LIMIT 1
