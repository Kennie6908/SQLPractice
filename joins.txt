We can use JOIN argument to combine information from two tables into one, using a shared column. 


-- find all branches and the names of their managers
-- in this case, we are selecting employee id, first name, and branch name. 
-- from two tables, employee table, and branch table (using join).
-- the ON argument specifies which two columns are the ones that are shared between the tables. 
-- USING REGULAR JOIN will ONLY DISPLAY ROWS WITH NO NULL VALUES
SELECT employee.emp_id, employee.first_name, branch.branch_name 
FROM employee
JOIN branch
ON employee.emp_id = branch.mgr_id

-- left join uses all rows from the left table (the one in the FROM argument)
-- this will display all of the employee names and ids, regardless of if they have branch names associated. 
SELECT employee.emp_id, employee.first_name, branch.branch_name 
FROM employee
LEFT JOIN branch
ON employee.emp_id = branch.mgr_id

-- right join uses all rows from the right table (the one in the RIGHT JOIN argument)
-- this will dispaly all of the branch names, regardless of if they have a employee id or name associated with it. 
SELECT employee.emp_id, employee.first_name, branch.branch_name 
FROM employee
RIGHT JOIN branch
ON employee.emp_id = branch.mgr_id
